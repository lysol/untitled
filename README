Derek's demo wiki app

I thought I'd have some fun, getting back into PHP, so made something
sort of like web.py or Sinatra/Express for the purposes of making a
simple application as a demonstration of simeple CRUD activities, minus the
D, since it's not really conducive to a wiki.

Included is a basic quasi-ActiveRecord style interface to a MySQL database,
GET/POST callbacks with URI parsing, and template rendering. Templates are
rendered using Twig, but the rest is DIY.

To properly implement, use the following .htaccess file and modify the
RewriteBase line to reflect the proper URL relative path.

<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
RewriteEngine on
RewriteBase /~darnold/untitled/
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} |-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} |-d
RewriteRule . index.php [L]
</IfModule>
